# AI-Factory: Specialized AI Development Subnet

**AI-Factory** AI Factory is a dedicated subnet accelerating AI research by combining automated ideation with community collaboration. Our AI Scientist Assistant generates novel paper ideas and outlines, enabling the rapid development of specialized AI pipelines. We also host key events: the AI Factory Conference, which showcases and peer-reviews new research, and the Community Workshop, focused on surveys and knowledge sharing.

## Scientist AI Tracks

### 1. Research Track (On going)

This track aims to develop AI models capable of generating original scientific ideas, with a particular emphasis on proposing new methods in the AI domain. Participants will explore the potential of generative AI in devising innovative solutions to complex scientific problems.

### 2. Demo Track (In progress)

The demo track serves as a platform to continuously produce AI models addressing specific problems, aiming to impress end-users and deliver value across various industries. We envision that, in the future, models from the research track could automate the ideation process for the demo track, reducing the need for manual brainstorming of intriguing AI topics.

## AI Factory Conference (In progress)

The AI Factory Conference is a decentralized research event that leverages the Bittensor network’s token emissions to incentivize high-quality AI research and peer review. Miners across the network are called upon to submit novel work, review their peers’ submissions, and collaboratively elevate the state of the art in machine learning and related fields.

## Community Workshop (On going)

Miners are invited to **contribute knowledge** by researching and presenting AI topics or papers (original or survey) in a concise video format. Approved presentations earn a share of Bittensor emissions and drive community learning.

## Getting Started
To set up and participate in AI-Factory, please refer to the following guides:

See [Scientist AI Competitions](docs/scientist_ai.md#getting-started)

See [Community Workshop](docs/workshop.md#getting-started) to learn how to submit presentation.

See [AI Factory Conference](docs/workshop.md#getting-started) to learn about the conference.

See [Validator Setup](docs/validator.md#getting-started) to learn how to set up a Validator.

Our codebase for the Scientist AI competition is adapted from Subnet 9, developed by Macrocosmos, which specializes in pre-training models within the Bittensor ecosystem. We extend our sincere gratitude to Macrocosmos for providing a strong foundation for our work. To manage contributions to the Community Workshop and AI Factory Conference, we use a separate system. Please refer to the documentation for more details.
