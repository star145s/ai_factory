## AI Factory Conference
**In progress**

The AI Factory Conference is a decentralized research event that leverages the Bittensor network’s token emissions to incentivize high-quality AI research and peer review. Miners across the network are called upon to submit novel work, review their peers’ submissions, and collaboratively elevate the state of the art in machine learning and related fields.

## Community Workshop 
**On going**

Miners are invited to **contribute knowledge** by researching and presenting AI topics or papers (original or survey) in a concise video format. Approved presentations earn a share of Bittensor emissions and drive community learning.
