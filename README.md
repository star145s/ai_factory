## About AI-Factory

AI-Factory focuses on developing AI models for specialized purposes, addressing unique challenges across diverse industries. Our mission is to harness the power of decentralized networks to create AI solutions that are efficient, scalable, and adaptable.

## Competition Tracks

We are excited to announce our upcoming competition, featuring two distinct tracks:

### 1. Research Track

This track aims to develop AI models capable of generating original scientific ideas, with a particular emphasis on proposing new methods in the AI domain. Participants will explore the potential of generative AI in devising innovative solutions to complex scientific problems.

### 2. Demo Track

The demo track serves as a platform to continuously produce AI models addressing specific problems, aiming to impress end-users and deliver value across various industries. We envision that, in the future, models from the research track could automate the ideation process for the demo track, reducing the need for manual brainstorming of intriguing AI topics.

## AI Factory Conference

The AI Factory Conference is a decentralized research event that leverages the Bittensor network’s token emissions to incentivize high-quality AI research and peer review. Miners across the network are called upon to submit novel work, review their peers’ submissions, and collaboratively elevate the state of the art in machine learning and related fields.

## Community Workshop

Miners are invited to **contribute knowledge** by researching and presenting AI topics or papers (original or survey) in a concise video format. Approved presentations earn a share of Bittensor emissions and drive community learning.

## Getting Started
To set up and participate in AI-Factory, please refer to the following guides:
