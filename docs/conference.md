## Introduction

The AI Factory Conference is a decentralized research event that leverages the Bittensor networkâ€™s token emissions to incentivize high-quality AI research and peer review. Miners across the network are called upon to submit novel work, review their peersâ€™ submissions, and collaboratively elevate the state of the art in machine learning and related fields.

## Vision & Objectives

- **Foster Collaboration**: Unite miners, validators, and AI practitioners in a shared venue for idea exchange.
- **Promote Transparency**: Publish all review scores, anonymized reviews, and evaluation criteria publicly.
- **Reward Merit**: Distribute Bittensor emissions based on objective quality metrics for both submissions and reviews.

## Incentive Mechanism

The conference has a separate scoring system but uses Bittensor emissions to encourage miners to research and publish their work:

- **Miners** submit research papers and implementations, earning emissions proportional to their review scores.
- **Validators** (other miners) evaluate submissions; accurate, well-calibrated reviews increase their trust weight and future emission share.

The detailed scoring system will be released next month when the system begins accepting papers.

## Conference Themes & Topics

Submissions are welcome in, but not limited to, the following areas:

- Large-scale language and vision-language models
- Continual event detection and dynamic environment learning
- Optimal transport methods in ML
- Federated and decentralized learning systems
- Robustness, security, and adversarial machine learning
- Ethics, fairness, and transparency in AI
- Novel architectures and efficiency improvements

## General Submission Guidelines

1. **Eligibility**: All Bittensor miners in good standing.
2. **Anonymity**: Papers and code repositories must not reveal author identities.
3. **Originality**: Work must be first published here; concurrent submissions elsewhere are allowed, but this venue takes precedence.
4. **Scope**: Emphasis on completed work. Clearly label any exploratory or preliminary results.
5. **Components**:
   - PDF paper (LaTeX, arXiv template)
   - Anonymous GitHub repository with all code, data scripts, and model checkpoints (mandatory)

## Formatting Requirements

- **Papers**: Minimum of 4 pages (excluding references and appendices)
- Use the **arXiv LaTeX template** (see Templates & Resources)
- Figures, tables, and algorithms count toward the page limit.

## Review & Evaluation Process

1. **Assignment**: Each miner submission is assigned to at least three peer miners for review.
2. **Scoring**: Papers are rated on:
   - Technical correctness and rigor
   - Originality and novelty
   - Significance and impact
   - Clarity and reproducibility
3. **Trust Metric**:
   - Reviewers earn trust based on the accuracy of past reviews, quality of their own research papers, and feedback from community workshops.
   - Reviews from higher-trust miners carry more weight in final scores.
4. **Transparency**: After decisions, all reviews, scores, and anonymized reviewer identities will be published on the conference site.

## Reward Distribution

A total of **50%** of Bittensorâ€™s miner emissions for the conference period will be allocated:

- **Authors**: 70% of the conference pool, distributed proportionally to final paper scores.
- **Reviewers**: 30% of the conference pool, split based on review quality and trust-weighted contributions.

## Important Dates

| Event              | Date         |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Submission Open    | June 1, 2025 |
| Community Workshop | May 28, 2025 |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Can I update my repository after submission?  
**A:** No, all code must be finalized at submission time to ensure fairness.

**Q:** How are conflicts of interest handled?  
**A:** Miners declare conflicts in the review system; conflicted reviews are automatically reassigned.

**Q:** Is there a registration fee?  
**A:** No, participation is open to all active Bittensor miners with no fees.
